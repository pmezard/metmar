# What is it?

`metmar` is a trivial proxy to fetch French marine weather forecasts on north
Brittany area and reformat them in plain text. The motivation for this is
instead of grabbing megabytes of Javascript, banners and ads which obviously
fail to load in poor network conditions, you get a readable forecast in a
single GET request. Isn't that nice?
